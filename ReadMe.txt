- In the folder named "scripts" you will find the different python codes that we have created.

- In the folder "launch" you will find all the launch files that you need to launch the three challenges.

* For challenge 1 : launch only the file challenge1.launch, who allows the robot to follow the line and avoid the obstacles

* For challenge 2 : launch the launch file challenge.launch which opens the simulated world, place the robot in the corridor then launch the node challenge2.py node in a new terminal.

* For challenge 3 : launch the launch file challenge.launch which opens the simulated world, place the robot at the entrance of the cluttered environment then launch the node challenge3.py node in a new terminal.

* For the passage from challenge 1 to challenge 2 to challenge 3 : launch only challenge123.launch who allows the robot to follow the line, enter and follow the corridor then enter to cluttered environment.
